    <h1>What is nodejs?</h1><br>
    <p>Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!<br>

        Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.</p><br>
        <p>A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.</p>
    
    
    
    
    <h1 id="item-1">What is the V8 engine?</h1><br>
    
    <p>V8 is the name of the JavaScript engine that powers Google Chrome. It's the thing that takes our JavaScript and executes it while browsing with Chrome.
        V8 provides the runtime environment in which JavaScript executes. The DOM, and the other Web Platform APIs are provided by the browser.
        The cool thing is that the JavaScript engine is independent of the browser in which it's hosted. This key feature enabled the rise of Node.js. V8 was chosen to be the engine that powered Node.js back in 2009, and as the popularity of Node.js exploded, V8 became the engine that now powers an incredible amount of server-side code written in JavaScript. The Node.js ecosystem is huge and thanks to V8 which also powers desktop apps, with projects like Electron.</p> <br>   
    
    <h1 >Other engines:</h1><br>

    <p>Other browsers have their own JavaScript engine:<br>

        * Firefox has SpiderMonkey<br>
        * Safari has JavaScriptCore (also called Nitro)<br>
        * Edge was originally based on Chakra but has more recently been rebuilt using Chromium and the V8 engine, and many others exist as well.</p><br>

    

    <h1 id="item-1-1">Making your project</h1><br>
    <p>Start by making your folder, where you will save your project and node modules.</p>

    <div class="py-3 px-3 bg-dark terminal">
        <p class="text-light">$ mkdir myapp <br> $ cd myapp</p>
    </div><br><br>

    <h1>Make a package.json</h1><br>

    <p>To make a package.json simply type <span class="fw-bold">npm init</span> and a file should be created on your
        selected
        folder. You can also type <span class="fw-bold">-y</span> after to say yes to everything. This command prompts you
        for a number
        of things, such as the name and version of your application. For now, you can simply hit
        RETURN to accept the defaults for most of them.</p>
        
    <div class="py-3 px-3 bg-dark terminal">
        <p class="text-light">$ npm init <br> $ npm init -y <span class="comment">//This is to
                accept everything in one go<span></p>
    </div><br>
