    <h1 id="item-1">Installing Express Framework</h1><br>

    <p>To install express simply do as follow:</p><br>
    <p>Make a new folder and change your directory into that folder</p>

    <div class="py-3 px-3 bg-dark terminal">
        <p class="text-light">$ mkdir myapp <br> $ cd myapp</p>
    </div><br>

    <h1 id="item-1-1">Make a package.json</h1><br>

    <p>To make a package.json simply type <span class="fw-bold">npm init</span> and a file should be created on your
        selected
        folder. You can also type <span class="fw-bold">-y</span> after to say yes to everything. This command prompts you
        for a number
        of things, such as the name and version of your application. For now, you can simply hit
        RETURN to accept the defaults for most of them.</p>
